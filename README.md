# Micromouse

This repository contains the code for the maze-solving mouse robot that I used to compete in the All American Micromouse Competition 2017 at UCLA. My team had a finish time of 2m20s and won the Best 1st Year Participant award.

The program is separated into various modules, some are self explanatory (Motor.cpp, IRSensor.cpp, Etc...)

# Dependencies
- QEI Library (for quadrature encoders). Just google mbed QEI and the most popular result is what I used.

I will expand more about the program when I have the time

### THIS IS THE SPAGHETTI CODE VERSION THAT I WORKED ON FOR 26 HOURS BEFORE THE COMPETITION
### I will fix this soon (comments and all)
###### hopefully... :)
